TestDescription: 'This testset assesses the performance of the KafkaPB component.


  KafkaPB is a class (on the OOP sense) which provides several methods to receive
  and send data to other plugins or to Smite2.


  Several examples are available, on the repository below.

  The current test sets up two KafkaPB objects, one to send data and another to receive
  data. Data (20 packets) is sent to a Kafka

  topic with the output object and collected from the same topic. Since packages arrive
  in order, just the UUID of the first

  package is verified, and the full count.'
