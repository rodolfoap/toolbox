Long description=In this case, at the core of this system is the concept of the Option object. These objects store either single values or lists of values depending on their type, as well as any documentation that goes with\nthe option in question and which should be presented to the user. Options are created with the following arguments: OptionType(name, value=None, documentation=None, short_explanation=None,\noption_widget_keywords = None, default = None). The short_explanation argument is currently not used by the default widgets but will be used in future versions. Option classes designed to allow the user to\nselect from a limited range of options may also be created with the choices argument.
