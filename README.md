Just some programming tests, from where I pick code chunks to make new stuff.

(see processing/cosine/)

(see processing/fractal/)

* Part of the code is not mine, but I keep it here just be easy to access: chuck, cobol, glade3, lex_yacc, linuxdrivers, opengl, perl, python, tcl, toy-compiler, vala.
